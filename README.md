# Castella

Castella is a transpiler that converts code written in the Castella language into C. It is essentially a reimagined version of C, infused with personal preferences for both semantics and syntax, designed to streamline development while maintaining compatibility with C's ecosystem. Castella uses the [tamago](https://crates.io/crates/tamago) crate to generate its C output.

Think of Castella as "C with a twist" â€” it keeps the spirit of C while introducing tweaks that reflect the ideals of the creator, bichanna.

## Features

- Transpiles to standard C code, ensuring compatibility.
- Syntax and semantics customized to enhance readability and usability.

# Castella

![Castella's logo](assets/logo.webp)

Castella is essentially a reimagined version of C, infused with personal preferences for both semantics and syntax. Castella uses the [tamago](https://crates.io/crates/tamago) crate to generate its C output.

## Goals

- Basically C with a little bit nicer syntax
- Transpiles to standard C code, ensuring compatibility
- Full manual memory management, just like in C, but with some niceties
- Built-in implementations of dynamic arrays, hash maps, and other useful things
- Use functions, types, and other stuff from C without too much fuss
- Not too many features being introduced
